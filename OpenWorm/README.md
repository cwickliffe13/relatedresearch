**Research Procedure and Breakthrough**


In the biological world, cellular ion channel mechanisms play a critical role in transferring encoded genetic make-up (in form of proteins) to the plasma membrane, which is at the center of cellular activities. Dysfunctionality or disturbance in any ion channel mechanism, as a result of inherited mutations or drug-induced inhibition, lead to life-threatening [channelopathies]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channelopathy) like Long-QT Syndrome, epilepsy, hearing loss, cystic fibrosis among many other genetic variant diseases. [Jiang]( https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Qiang_Jiang5), et al. conducted an experiment to validate their proposed method aimed at finding out disease-relevant ion channel modulators in small molecules using *C. elegans’* Channelopathy models.  The authors validated their phenotype-based screening strategy by experimentally expressing a mutated, hybrid, human ether-a-go-go-related Gene (hERG) in *C. elegans* and observing defective ion channel behavior: with the aim of establishing the relevant small molecule modulator responsible for correcting channel dysfunction.  From their strategy, high-throughput screening methods can be developed for other ion channel dysfunctions, which result from different gene mutations or drug-induced ion channel inhibitions. The developed strategy is important in the discovery of ion channel drugs. 


*Procedure*


+. The authors first generated a human-worm ‘trafficking-defective’ or a** chimeric ion** channel by fusing GFP to a chimeric **hERG(hERGchimera/A536W::GFP**, consisting of: N-terminus and C-terminus of *UNC-103*, transmembrane, cyclic nucleotide-binding domains of **hERG**, and a gain-of-function mutation A536W. The A536W mutation is the voltage –dependent activation of the** hERG potassium ion channels **to a much more negative potential. 


+. Expression of unc-103 promoter-driven **hERGchimera/A536W::GFP **proteins in N2 wild-type worms generated transgenic worms *(hERGchimera/A536W)* with clear defects in locomotion and egg-laying. 



+. The generated* hERGchimera/A536W *transgenic worms were then cross bred with *acs-20 null *mutant worms to get *acs-20;hERGchimera/A536W  *mutant worms, whose cuticles have enhanced permeability for small molecular compounds.  This step enabled the ingestion of small molecular compounds as potential ion channel activators or inhibitors.


+. The *acs-20;hERGchimera/A536W  *mutant worms were then fed with bacteria expressing double-strand RNAs targeting *ifd-2* and *c15c7.5*, two genes encoding nonessential intestinal intermediate filament proteins that impede the effects of ingested compounds. 


+. The authors then screened about 4000 small molecules for their suppression of behavioral defects in **acs-20;hERGchimera/A536W **worms.




** Identification of functional correctors of Type 2 Long-QT Syndrome (LQTS2) mutant channels**



%. The authors introduced a trafficking-defective **Long-QT Syndrome** mutation A561V to the **hERGchimera/A536W protein**.


%. The authors then observed, under a microscope, ** neuronal cytoplasm** activity of transgenic worms expressing **hERGchimera/A536W/A561V::GFP proteins**. 

%. After observing mistrafficking of the **hERGchimera/A536W/A561V::GFP proteins** , the authors generated **acs-20;hERGchimera/A536W/A561V** worms by crossing **acs-20 null mutant worms** with **hERGchimera/A536W/A561V** transgenic worms. The newly generated **acs-20;hERGchimera/A536W/A561V** worms could ingest small molecule compounds, and by screening about 10,600 compounds at a final concentration of 20 μM, the authors identified six compounds that enhanced protein trafficking to the plasma membrane. Prostatin and Ingenol-3,20-dibenzoate(IDB) were the two strongly identified.



%. The authors specifically narrowed down to examining whether Prostatin and IDB had significant trafficking effect in co-expressed **wild-type hERG** (**hERGWT**)and a **A561V mutated hERG (**hERGA561V**)channels  using a 2:1 Prostatin-IDB concentration ratio, respectively. Co-expression (of **hERGWT-hERGA561V **) was necessary because:

>hERG mutations are heterozygous in most LQTS2 patients.






%. IDB and Prostatin were also screened in  hERG K+ channels with other LQTS-related  mutations such as I31S, G601S, A561 site, T65P, N470D, and S818L.



%. The authors then generated three mutated hERG K+ channels lacking PKC phosphorylation sites in the N-terminus, the transmembrane domains, or the C-terminus with the aim of establishing which phosphorylation site is required for the function of IDB and Prostratin. 



%. The authors next  mutated S606 to E606 to mimic the phosphorylation of **hERG K+ channels**, and found that the mutation **S606E** in **hERGA561V** markedly increased the current density of **hERGWT-hERGA561V**.





**Identified compounds restore electrophysiology of cardiomyocytes carrying a LQTS2 mutation**



The authors carried another set of procedure aimed at identifying electrophysiological phenotypes in cardiomyocytes carrying Long-QT Syndrome mutation (**hiPSCA561V-CMs**) and explored whether Prostatin and IDB could correct the electrophysiological defects in the same:

-	First, the authors obtained human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from LQTS2 patients (with a heterozygous A561V mutation in hERG) and then generated a heterozygous A561V mutation in hiPSCs by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing.


-	The authors then differentiated the hiPSCs into cardiomyocytes; named **hiPSCA561V-CMs**. 



-	After that, the authors confirmed the cardiac ontogeny of both control **hiPSC-CMs and hiPSCA561V-CMs** by analyses of cardiac cell-specific transcriptional, structural, and functional markers. 


-	The** hiPSCA561V-CMs** was then immunostained to exhibit protein accumulation in the cell cytoplasm. 


-	Lastly, the authors administered Prostratin (3 μM) or IDB (2 μM) to the control sample ;**hiPSC-CMs** and the experimental sample;  **hiPSCA561V-CMs** to explore if Prostratin and IDB could correct the electrophysiological defects of **hiPSCA561V-CMs**.


**Breakthroughs and Validations**

#. We found that phenotypes in hERGchimera/A536W worms were ameliorated by individually adding 10 μM well-known hERG blockers, and these effects were markedly enhanced when the **acs-20 null mutation** was introduced in the transgenic worms .The result indicates that drugs could be efficiently delivered to their targets, and modified human ion channels expressed in the transgenic worms are functional and the cause of behavioral defects.


#. From the 4000 screened small molecule compounds, dozens restored locomotion and egg-laying behaviors of the tested worms to varying degrees; with ** alphitolic acid (ALA) ** among the compounds having the highest restoration. 

#. Additional test using HEK293T cells expressing **wildtype hERG K+** channels showed that acute treatment with either 1 or 10μM ALA did not change the **wildtype hERG K+** channel current density, suggesting that ALA did not act directly on **hERG K+ **channel. However, 24–32 h (long-term) treatment with ALA led to reduced current density of this channel in a dose-dependent manner.

#. The authors then examined  whether **acs-20;hERGchimera/A536W **   worms could be used for identification of** hERG K+ ** channel modulators. 



#. Six compounds, among them, prostatin and ingenol-3,20-dibenzoate rescued trafficking defects in the transgenic worms expressing **hERGchimera/A536W/A561V::GFP proteins** through protein Kinase C signaling. 

>Western blotting experiments showed that both Prostratin and IDB promoted trafficking of **hERGWT-hERGA561V **channels in a dose-dependent pattern.


#. After treating hERG K+ channels bearing other LQTS-related mutations such as I31S, G601S, A561 site, T65P, N470D, and S818L with 3 μM Prostratin or 2 μM IDB, the authors realized enhanced ion channel functionality for all mutations excerpt for T65Pand N470D, which were not affected by the drug administration. 



> Prostratin and IDB specifically promote the function of some trafficking-defective hERG mutant channels.




#. The authors realized, after further exploration, that only blockage of phosphorylation sites in the transmembrane domains diminished the function of IDB and Prostratin. 


#. After mutating S606 to E606 to mimic the phosphorylation of **hERG K+channels**, the authors found that the mutation *S606E* in *hERGA561V *markedly increased the current density of ** hERGWT-hERGA561V**. 


> our results suggest that IDB and Prostratin activate the PKCε signaling and consequently phosphorylate S606 at the pore region of the channel to correct the defective function of LQTS2
mutant channels.




#. The authors established that Prostratin and IDB corrected electrophysiological abnormalities in LQTS2-specific hiPSC-CMs. 




>small-molecule compounds similar to Prostratin and IDB are potential drugs for treating patients with LQTS2.




> We found that endogenous IKr currents, isolated by the hERG blocker E-4031, in hiPSCA561V-CMs were significantly decreased in comparison with those in control hiPSC-CMs. In consistence with this result, immunostaining of hiPSCA561V-CMs showed that hERGA561V proteins accumulated in the cytoplasm. Concurrently, the APD90 (actionpotential duration at 90% of full re-polarization) of atrial-like
and ventricular-like hiPSCA561V-CMs was about two times longer than that of control hiPSC-CMs. Furthermore, action potentials in 5 out of 22 hiPSCA561V-CMs exhibited early afterdepolarization
(EAD), the harbinger of cardiac arrhythmias in LQTS, while none of action potentials in control hiPSC-CMs (n = 25) showed EADs. Thus, the electrophysiological phenotypes in hiPSCA561V-CMs were similar
to those in LQTS2 patient-specific hiPSC-CMs.







#. The authors provide an in vivo system for the discovery of ion channel modulators, which presents a novel pharmacological correction of trafficking defects resulting from genetic mutation in ion channels. 





**Assupmtions/What to Look out for**


1.	The authors could not fully express hERG potassium ion in *C. elegans* because of mistrafficking of the channel. 


2.	The authors assume that the expression of a Long-QT Syndrome mutated hERG potassium ion as a human-worm hybrid (**hERG(hERGchimera/A536W::GFP**, consisting of: N-terminus and C-terminus of *UNC-103*, transmembrane, cyclic nucleotide-binding domains of **hERG**) will exhibit similar trafficking behavior along disease-related ion channels in both *C. elegans* and *human ion channels*.


> We thus assumed that a chimeric ion channel consisting of transmembrane domains and their connecting loops of a human ion channel, and N-/C-terminus of its C. elegans homolog, would largely maintain pharmacological properties of the human ion channel and could be functionally expressed in C. elegans.


3.	It is not clear what criteria the authors used to sample small molecule compounds that were screened for their ‘trafficking action potentials’ in the sampled mutated ion channels.





**Direction for Future Research**


The authors proposed that *C. elegans models* of channelopathies could be generated for other channels besides the hERG K+ channel to develop drug discovery strategies by researching phynotype-based screening of ion channel mechanism in other mutant ion channels besides hERG K+ channel.




**Application**



The proposed strategy forms a strong and efficient basis for the development of high-throughput screening systems that can be incorporated into Channelopathy drug-discovery models for optimization.
