#### What was the purpose of this study and how was it achieved?

The purpose of this paper was to investigate joint action of two rowers after training together in an intensive national training program. This study is a follow-up case report regarding a previous study by R’Kiouak and colleagues (2016).  The initial study analyzed how individual experts rowed together without first practicing rowing together.  The present study served as a follow-up study to investigate how both rowers synchronize their rowing actions after having intensively practiced joint action.  

The study tracked the joint action of two individual expert rowers who trained together first, and compared their joint action to the previous study in which two rowers rowed together without training together.

There were two main parts to this study:

1)	The researchers first determined how each rower experienced the joint action at each instance of oars’ strokes during a 12 min race.  A phenomenological analysis evidenced several categories of how rowers shared lived experiences of their joint action, e.g., whether they found their simultaneous and similar lived rowing experiences detrimental, meaningless, or effective.  From mechanical data captured through an automatic recording device, the researchers then scrutinized the mechanical signatures that correlated with each phenomenological sample.


2)	The results of this study were then compared to the initial study.  The results suggested that, after the training program (a) rowers shared more meaningful experience of their joint action, and (b) only the boat velocity’s index contributed to explain why oars stroke were alternatively lived as effective or detrimental.  The results of the present study suggest that joint action training in rowing can help increase joint sense-making due to a change from an inter-personal to an extra-personal meaningful mode of coregulation of the joint action.

#### Why is this research important?

This research is important because it examines human collective behaviors and their emergence via synchronization processes.  

> Individuals regulate their behaviors with regards for what they perceive as the emerging needs of the collective activity.  Based on how they experience the accuracy of their real-time activity, humans adapt online by maintaining or changing their involvement. This adaptive and regulatory activity allows to obtain the states of Actor(s)/Environment (A/E) coupling that are required/expected regarding the current joint task (i.e., collective coordinative task). In the literature two very distinct processes can be found that ground the way interactors regulate their joint action, which are the inter- and extra-personal modes of co-regulation.

#### What is the breakthrough?

The study finds that joint action training may increase joint sense-making activities, which may be associated with a change from interpersonal to extrapersonal meaningful mode of action.  In interpersonal modes of coregulation, each participant guides their own actions and adaptations to the current needs of joint action by taking into account the other teammate's behavior and resulting synchronization states.  In extrapersonal co-regulation, participants adjust the dynamics of their behavior by taking into account their own behavior with little attention to others' behavior.

The study probes synchronization states by asking rowers to verbalize their feelings related to joint action, and by collecting phenomenological data about the lived rowing experience (e.g., by inquiring whether joint actions were simultaneously and similarly experienced as detrimental).  The phenomenological data could be categorized in one of four categories:

- SSE-M - Simultaneously and Similarly Experienced as Meaningless
- SSE-D - Simultaneously and Similarly Experienced as Detrimental
- SSE-E - Simultaneously and Similarly Experienced as Effective
- SDE - Simultaneously Divergent Experiences

The mechanical data associated with the phenomenological categories (SSE-M, SSE-D, SSE-E, SDE) underwent further statistical analysis to identify the level of joint action's organization (whether it was individual, interpersonal, or boat level) that could best explain the differences in the four collective phenomenological categories.  These categories were examined on individual, group, and boat levels.

> The results indicated that the proposed explicative factors of the salient shared experience of the rowers' activity might be found at the boat level of analysis after training, whereas no significant insights were observed at this level of analysis during the pre-program race. 

Previous studies investigating human movement have looked at interpersonal modes of action but have not explored extrapersonal modes and how the transition from interpersonal to extrapersonal modes can occur.
